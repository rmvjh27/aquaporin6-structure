# Predicting and Visualizing the Structure of the Human Aquaporin-6 Tetramer
## Background information
From UniProt entry Q13520 for the Human Aquaporin-6: 
- Aquaporins form homotetrameric transmembrane channels, with each monomer independently mediating water transport across the plasma membrane along its osmotic gradient.
- Unlike classical aquaporins, AQP6 is an intracellular channel with selective anion permeability, particularly for nitrate, and exhibits very low water permeability.
- It may also facilitate the transport of gases, such as CO2 and NH4+.
## Workflow
### 1. Retrieve the structure of the human aquaporin-6 monomer (AFDB ID Q13520) from AlphaFold DB
The structure colored by the pLDDT value of each residue:
![Q13520_structure]
2. Visualize the amino acid residues with high AlphaMissense pathogenicity
